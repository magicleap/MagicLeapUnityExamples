# Magic Leap Unity Examples

## Overview
This project contains example scenes demonstrating how to use Magic Leap features with the Magic Leap Unity SDK package, and has been configured to help the user quickly jump in and start developing for the Magic Leap 2.

The files in this project can change or even be removed from one release to another. If you're planning on depending or modifying these assets for your own project, we recommend that you duplicate the files, change the names and move them out of the Assets/MagicLeap folder. This will avoid issues like your changes being deleted when you upgrade to a new unitypackage.
